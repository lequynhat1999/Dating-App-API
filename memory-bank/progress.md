**What Works:**
- Memory bank initialization is complete with `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md` created.

**What's Left to Build:**
- .NET API project setup.
- Core API functionalities:
    - User registration and authentication.
    - User profile management.
    - Matching algorithm.
    - Messaging.
- Database setup and integration.
- API endpoint development.
- Unit and integration tests.
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
- Deployment pipeline.

**Current Status:**

- Ready to start .NET API project setup.

**Known Issues:**
- None at this stage.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- Database choice initially leaning towards SQL Server for development ease, with PostgreSQL as a production alternative. (Decision documented in `activeContext.md`)
