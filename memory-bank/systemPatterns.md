# System Patterns: Dating App API

**System Architecture:**
- **Three-Layer Architecture:** The API will follow a three-layer architecture:
    - **Presentation Layer (API Controllers):** Handles HTTP requests and responses, routing, and input validation.
    - **Business Logic Layer (Services):** Contains the core business logic of the application, orchestrating operations and interacting with the data access layer.
    - **Data Access Layer (Repositories/Data Context):**  Handles database interactions, data retrieval, and persistence.

**Design Patterns:**
- **Repository Pattern:** To abstract data access logic and decouple the business logic from the database implementation.
- **Service Pattern:** To encapsulate business logic and provide a clear separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Injection:** To manage dependencies and promote loose coupling and testability.
- **RESTful API Principles:** To design a stateless and scalable API.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) (Potentially):**  To separate read and write operations for optimization and scalability if needed in the future.
- **Unit of Work (Potentially):** To manage database transactions and ensure data consistency.

**Component Relationships:**
- Controllers will depend on Services.
- Services will depend on Repositories and potentially other Services.
- Repositories will depend on the Data Context.
- Dependency Injection will be used to manage these relationships.

**Critical Implementation Paths:**
- User Registration and Authentication flow.
- Profile Creation and Management flow.
- Matching Algorithm implementation.
- Messaging functionality implementation.
- API Endpoint security and authorization.
